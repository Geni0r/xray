> Note: xray is not open source, just download the built binary files directly. The repository mainly contains community-contributed POCs. Each xray release will automatically package them.

## ‚ú® xray 2.0

To address the issue of xray 1.0 becoming complex and bloated with added features, we have launched xray 2.0.

This new version aims to enhance the smoothness of functionality, lower the usage threshold, and help more security industry practitioners achieve a better experience more efficiently. xray 2.0 will integrate a series of new security tools to form a comprehensive security toolset.

**The second tool in the xray 2.0 series, xapp, is now online, welcome to try it!**

### XPOC

xpoc is the first tool in the xray 2.0 series, designed as a rapid emergency response tool for supply chain vulnerability scanning.

Project address: https://github.com/chaitin/xpoc

### XAPP

xapp is a tool focused on web fingerprint identification. You can use xapp to identify the technologies used by web targets and prepare for security testing.

Project address: https://github.com/chaitin/xapp

### Plugin Repository

We have created a dedicated repository for various plugins, aimed at facilitating the sharing and use of different plugins.

It mainly collects open-source scripts converted into xray format for everyone to use.

We will periodically push some new plugins here and hope everyone will actively optimize or submit plugins to enrich this repository together.

Project address: https://github.com/chaitin/xray-plugins

## üöÄ Quick Usage

**Before using, be sure to read and agree to the terms in the [License](https://github.com/chaitin/xray/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file. If not, please do not install or use this tool.**

1. Use the basic crawler to scan the links crawled by the crawler for vulnerabilities

    ```bash
    xray webscan --basic-crawler http://example.com --html-output vuln.html
    ```

2. Use HTTP proxy for passive scanning

    ```bash
    xray webscan --listen 127.0.0.1:7777 --html-output proxy.html
    ```
   Set the browser's HTTP proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:7777`, then you can automatically analyze proxy traffic and scan it.

   > To scan HTTPS traffic, please read the "Capture HTTPS Traffic" section below.

3. Scan a single URL without using a crawler

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b --html-output single-url.html
    ```

4. Manually specify plugins for this run

   By default, all built-in plugins will be enabled. You can specify the plugins to be enabled for this scan with the following commands.

   ```bash
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --url http://example.com
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --listen 127.0.0.1:7777
   ```

5. Specify Plugin Output

   You can specify to output the vulnerability information of this scan to a file:

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b \
    --text-output result.txt --json-output result.json --html-output report.html
    ```
